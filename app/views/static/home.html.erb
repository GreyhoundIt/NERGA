<h1>Welcome to the Website of NERGA &#8211; The North East Rabbits Golf Association.</h1>
<p>NERGA was formed in 2010 and has two major aims, to provide Inter Club golf competition for high and medium range handicap players and to generate revenue for participating Clubs.</p>
<p>It is the only Leagues of its kind in the North where Clubs as far afield as Newcastle in Northumberland ,  York in North Yorkshire , Whitby,Filey and Scarborough on our East coast come together as a League to play team golf in a friendly atmosphere,but with a competitive twist to it.</p>
<p>2015 NERGA (16 to 28 handicap) has grown to 30 Clubs in 4 Zone Leagues.Nearly 500 players will compete as individuals and within their Club teams  for a place in the Finals day at Rockliffe Hall in October to become 2015 NERGA Club &amp; Individual Champion.</p>
<p>From the success of NERGA we have this year launch a new division INTER –(10 to 15 handicap) giving this group of players the opportunity to play in Inter Club golf competition.  15 Clubs formed into 2 Zone Leagues are competing in this first year for a place in the INTER Finals day at Rockliffe Hall in October to become the INTER Club and Individual Champions.</p>
<p>Our format is unique and is a winning formula</p>
<p>A match day consists of  7 Clubs of 8 players playing Stableford , Full Handicap competition.  From these 8 players the best 7 scores are added together and become the Club score for the day’s competition.  Each  Club is then  allocated league points on the day from  7pts down to 1pt and at the end of all the Zone matches it is the Club with the most League points who tops the Zone League and goes on to compete against all the other Zone League winners in the NERGA / INTER Championship Finals day.</p>
<p>Each Club in the Zone League hosts one weekend fixture which brings in approx £800 revenue to the Club ,   in the season each Club plays 1 home match and 6 away matches.</p>
<p>NERGA / INTER benefits both Club and members. It provides good inter Club competition , it developes  new Club and player relationships and generates good income to all participating Clubs. It also provides the chance to play in the Finals day at Rockliffe Hall.</p>
<p>Each season we re-mix the Zone League  which keeps the League&#8217;s refreshed and interesting and provides more Club and player relationships.</p>
<p>To date we have grown year on year  and our ambition is to continue this growth in the future , and we are already talking to a number of Clubs  who wish to join us 2016.
